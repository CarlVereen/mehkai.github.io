        <h2 class="section-header">What is an Object</h3>
      </header>
      <p> JavaScript is designed on a simple object-based paradigm. An object is a collection of properties,
        and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value. A property's value can be a function,
        in which case the property is known as a method. In addition to objects that are predefined in the browser,
        you can define your own objects. This chapter describes how to use objects, properties, functions, and methods, and how to create your own objects.
        <br />
        <br />
        Objects in JavaScript, just as in many other programming languages, can be compared to
        objects in real life. The concept of objects in JavaScript can be understood with real life,
        tangible objects. In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type.
        Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc.
        The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.
      </p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Objects_and_properties">
      <header>
        <h2 class="section-header">Objects and properties</h3>
      </header>
      <p> A JavaScript object has properties associated with it. A property of an object can be explained as a variable
          that is attached to the object. Object properties are basically the same as ordinary JavaScript variables, except
          for the attachment to objects. The properties of an object define the characteristics of the object. You access
          the properties of an object with a simple dot-notation:
          <code>objectName.propertyName</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        Like all JavaScript variables, both the object name (which could be a normal variable) and property name are case sensitive.
        You can define a property by assigning it a value. For example, let's create an object named myCar and give it properties
        named make, model, and year as follows:
        <code>var myCar = new Object();
              myCar.make = 'Ford';
              myCar.model = 'Mustang';
              myCar.year = 1969;
        </code>
      </p>


    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Creating_new_objects">
      <header>
        <h2 class="section-header">Creating new objects</h3>
      </header>
      <p>
        There are 3 main ways to create new objects:
      </p>
      <ul><a href="#"></a>
        <li><a class="obj-sec-link" href="#Using_object_initializers" target="_self">Using object initializers</a></li>
        <li><a class="obj-sec-link" href="#Using_a_constructor_function" target="_self">Using a constructor function</a></li>
        <li><a class="obj-sec-link" href="#Using_the_Object_create_method" target="_self">Using the Object.create method</a></li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="Using_object_initializers">Using object initializers</h5>
      <p>
        In addition to creating objects using a constructor function, you can create objects using an object initializer.
        Using object initializers is sometimes referred to as creating objects with literal notation. "Object initializer"
        is consistent with the terminology used by C++. The syntax for an object using an object initializer is:
        <code>
          var obj = { property_1:   value_1,   // property_# may be an identifier...
            2:            value_2,   // or a number...
            // ...,
            'property n': value_n }; // or a string
        </code>
        where obj is the name of the new object, each property_i is an identifier (either a name, a number, or a string literal),
        and each value_i is an expression whose value is assigned to the property_i. The obj and assignment is optional; if you do
        not need to refer to this object elsewhere, you do not need to assign it to a variable. (Note that you may need to wrap the
        object literal in parentheses if the object appears where a statement is expected, so as not to have the literal be confused
        with a block statement.) Object initializers are expressions, and each object initializer results in a new object being
        created whenever the statement in which it appears is executed. Identical object initializers create distinct objects that
        will not compare to each other as equal. Objects are created as if a call to new Object() were made; that is, objects made from
        object literal expressions are instances of Object.
      </p>
      <h3 id="Using_a_constructor_function">Using a constructor function</h5>
      <p>
        Alternatively, you can create an object with these two steps:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Define the object type by writing a constructor function.There is a strong convention, with good reason, to use a capital initial letter.
          </li>
          <li>
            Create an instance of the object with new.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
         To define an object type, create a function for the object type that specifies its name, properties, and methods. For example, suppose you want
         to create an object type for cars. You want this type of object to be called Car, and you want it to have properties for make, model, and year.
         To do this, you would write the following function:
         <code>
           function Car(make, model, year) {
              this.make = make;
              this.model = model;
              this.year = year;
            }
         </code>
         Notice the use of this to assign values to the object's properties based on the values passed to the function. Now you can create an
         object called mycar as follows:
         <code>
           var mycar = new Car('Eagle', 'Talon TSi', 1993);
         </code>

      </p>
      <h3 id="Using_the_Object_create_method">Using the Object.create method</h5>
      <p>
        Objects can also be created using the Object.create() method. This method can be very useful, because it allows you to choose the prototype object for the object you want to create, without having to define a constructor function.
        <code>
          // Animal properties and method encapsulation
              var Animal = {
                type: 'Invertebrates', // Default value of properties
                displayType: function() {  // Method which will display type of Animal
                  console.log(this.type);
                }
              };

              // Create new animal type called animal1
              var animal1 = Object.create(Animal);
              animal1.displayType(); // Output:Invertebrates

              // Create new animal type called Fishes
              var fish = Object.create(Animal);
              fish.type = 'Fishes';
              fish.displayType(); // Output:Fishes
        </code>

      </header>
      <p>
        Objects make up the core of JavaScript as a language. Commonly used built-in constructs such as String,
        Number, Date, Array, Object (duh) and Function are all constructor functions that return objects. So: ‘this text’
        is constructed using the String constructor, and the output is actually an object.
